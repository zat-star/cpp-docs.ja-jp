# <a name="ltcodecvtgt"></a>&lt;codecvt&gt;
Defines several template classes that describe objects based on template class [codecvt](../standard-library/codecvt-class.md). These objects can serve as [locale facets](../standard-library/locale-class.md#facet_class) that control conversions between a sequence of values of type `Elem` and a sequence of values of type `char`.  
  
## <a name="syntax"></a>Syntax  
  
```  
#include <codecvt>  
  
```  
  
## <a name="remarks"></a>Remarks  
 The locale facets declared in this header convert between several character encodings. For wide characters (stored within the program in fixed-size integers):  
  
-   UCS-4 is Unicode (ISO 10646) encoded within the program  
  
-   UCS-4 is Unicode (ISO 10646) encoded within the program as a 32-bit integer.  
  
-   UCS-2 is Unicode encoded within the program  
  
-   UCS-2 is Unicode encoded within the program as a 16-bit integer.  
  
-   UTF-16 is Unicode encoded within the program as either one  
  
-   UTF-16 is Unicode encoded within the program as either one or two 16-bit integers. (Note that this does not meet all the requirements of a valid wide-character encoding for Standard C or Standard C++. Nevertheless it is widely used as such.)  
  
 For byte streams (stored in a file, transmitted as a byte sequence, or stored within the program in an array of `char`):  
  
-   UTF-8 is Unicode encoded  
  
-   UTF-8 is Unicode encoded within a byte stream as one or more eight-bit bytes with a deterministic byte order.  
  
-   UTF-16LE is Unicode encoded  
  
-   UTF-16LE is Unicode encoded within a byte stream as UTF-16 with each 16-bit integer presented as two eight-bit bytes, less significant byte first.  
  
-   UTF-16BE is Unicode encoded  
  
-   UTF-16BE is Unicode encoded within a byte stream as UTF-16 with each 16-bit integer presented as two eight-bit bytes, more significant byte first.
