# <a name="role-of-the-view-in-printing"></a>Role of the View in Printing
Your view also plays two important roles in printing its associated document.  
  
 The view:  
  
-   Uses the same [OnDraw](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#ondraw) code to draw on the printer as to draw on the screen.  
  
-   Manages dividing the document into pages for printing.  
  
 For more information about printing and about the view's role in printing, see [Printing and Print Preview](../mfc/printing-and-print-preview.md).
